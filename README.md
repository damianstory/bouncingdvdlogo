# Bouncing DVD Logo GIF Generator

This is a Next.js application that creates a nostalgic DVD logo bouncing animation. Users can upload their own logo, choose different aspect ratios, and download the result as an animated GIF.

## Current Issue - GIF Generation

The application has an issue where the GIF generation process gets stuck at 90% and doesn't complete properly. We need help debugging this issue.

### Key Files and Components

- `src/app/components/DVDContainer.tsx` - The main component that manages the container, the bouncing logo, and GIF generation
- `src/app/components/DVDLogo.tsx` - The component responsible for the bouncing logo animation
- `public/gif.worker.js` - Worker script for the GIF.js library

### GIF Generation Process

The GIF generation process is handled in the `startRecording` function in `DVDContainer.tsx`. Here's how it works:

1. The canvas captures frames of the bouncing logo
2. Frames are added to a GIF object with a 100ms delay between each frame
3. The GIF is rendered and downloaded

### Specific Issues

- GIF generation seems to get stuck at 90% progress
- Error logging suggests it might be related to the `gif.worker.js` or frame processing
- We've implemented a fallback to static image download if GIF generation fails

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
